## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

#### 1. **Semantic HTML and Structure**

- **Key Learning**: Understanding the importance of semantic HTML elements (like `<article>`, `<header>`, and `<footer>`) helps improve accessibility and SEO.
- **Example**: Using `<article>` to wrap the blog preview card helps indicate that it contains a standalone piece of content.

```html
<article class="card">
  <h1 class="title">HTML & CSS Foundations</h1>
  <p class="description">
    These languages are the backbone of every website...
  </p>
</article>
```

#### 2. **Troubleshooting Deployment Issues**

- **Key Learning**: Understanding how to troubleshoot common issues, like 404 errors due to incorrect file paths, is crucial for successful deployment.
- **Example**: Realizing that leading slashes in file paths can cause the server to look for files in the wrong location.

### Continued development

#### Accessibility (a11y)

- **Focus Area**: Learn best practices for making web applications more accessible to users with disabilities.
- **Goal**: Ensure that your projects are usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities.
- **Action Item**: Review existing projects for accessibility issues and apply tools like Lighthouse to audit your code.

### Useful resources

- [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) â€” This article outlines the Git Flow branching model, which is perfect for managing releases and feature development. It provided clarity on how to structure my branches for better organization, and I intend to use this model in future projects to maintain cleaner repositories.

- [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/articles/accessibility/) - This resource offered a solid introduction to web accessibility principles and practices. It helped me understand the importance of making websites usable for everyone, and I found the checklists particularly useful for auditing my projects.
